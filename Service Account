When service account is created, it is also creates a token, with which the external application is authenticated, 

service account --> service account object ---> token ----> secret.

When the application is hosted as a pod in the K8s cluster. then configuring the token is not needed just as it is done in the external application. in that case the token is mounted into the pod.
by default, the default service account is mounted in the pods.


After 1.22 and 1.24, significant changes were made , in service account token issuance ,where the tokens which were generated by default , which were indefinite were removed, 
and tokenrequest API is used to issue token which will expire (time based)

with the new method, the service account admission controller and token request API , will create token which is mounted as projected volume into the pod.

we can still create s-token in old way, a non expiring token, using the service account version. also we have to create a service account first before creating the token.
