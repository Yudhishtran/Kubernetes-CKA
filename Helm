Helm is a automation extension for the K8s cluster (simply, a software package manager), Helm works on charts which are yaml files with deployments and services written as templates,
only the values are attached for the release any changes within the release is defined as revision plans.
  Helm 2 and Helm 3 , before introduciton of RBAC and CRDs, helm 2 worked with tiller, Helm 3 works without tiller.

Helm-chart is the K8s configuration and yaml files, When a rollback is made , this is reflected as a new revision in helm.
Helm 2 is limited in revision management, it doesnt notice manual changes done to the helm deployment. Helm 3 over comes this, The Helm 3 uses,
3-way stratergic merge patch.
It checks,


Previous chart -----> Current chart ----> Live state ----> Previous chart


This notices any independent changes in the helm based components and does the rollback accordingly.

Helm charts are stored in online repos, artifacthub.io is the main repo for charts.

Helm uses metadata to store the charts and current revision and releases as kubernetes secrets (ie within the cluster).
