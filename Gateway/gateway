Gateway API is organized into different API kinds that have interdependent relationships to support the role-oriented nature of organizations.
A Gateway object is associated with exactly one GatewayClass; the GatewayClass describes the gateway controller responsible for managing Gateways of this class. 
One or more route kinds such as HTTPRoute, are then associated to Gateways. A Gateway can filter the routes that may be attached to its listeners, forming a bidirectional trust model with routes.

HTTPRoute --> Gateway --> Gatewayclass

client --> HTTP request --> Gateway --> HTTPRoute (follows the routing rule) --> service --> pods
